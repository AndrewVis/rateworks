My goal for this project was to create a platform for financial instutions to be able to communicate more effectively with intermediaries that sell their products. Coming from the finance industry, I found there was a problem space that would ultimately create a better customer experience for anyone involved in certain transactions if there was a more effcient way for the two parties to communicate. Through my app Rate Works, financial institutions would be able to update the rapidly changing lending rates being given out in todays economies in real time for brokers to be offering their clients. 

In the spirit of trying new things, I used a tech stack that was completely new to me. For the front end I used a combination of NEXT.js and Tailwind css which I found extremely fun to use; for the back end I used SupaBase which runs off a PostgreSQL database. I found it very fulfilling being able to pickup new technologies and frameworks and generate an entire project in such a short timeframe. 

Moving forward I will be working on some additional functionalities and expanding the abilities of the application to be able to sustain more business generated from across other areas of the financial sector i.e Mutual Funds, Foreign exchange trading. 

If you wanted to take a look, the directions are listed below!
